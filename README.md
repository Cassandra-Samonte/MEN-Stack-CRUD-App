## User Stories
## User Story 1: Collector and Community Contributor
- As a passionate album collector and member of the vaporwave community, I want a dedicated application to archive and showcase my growing album collection. With this app, I will be able to contribute to the vibrancy of the vaporwave genre by creating a centralized hub to share my collection. This will allow others to listen, share feedback, and engage with the content.
   - With this app I will be able to:
      - Add new albums to the collection with essential data.
      - Update album details and status.
      - Remove albums that are no longer relevant to my collection.
  
## User Story 2: Casual Web Visitor
- As a casual internet user interested in music, I want to discover this album collection and learn about the vaporwave genre, explore the albums, discover artists, and understand where to purchase or listen to the albums.
   - With this app I will be able to:
      - Browse albums.
      - Gain access to detailed information about each album and artist.
      - Have the ability to read reviews by other users of the application.
      - Have the option to contribute my own reviews or thoughts on albums.

## User Story 3: Prospective Employer
- As a prospective employer evaluating tech talent, I want to assess the developerâ€™s capabilities through this application so that I can determine whether their skill set aligns with the needs of my organization.
   - With this app I will be able to:
      - Evaluate a fully functioning application built using MEN-Stack (MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, Node.js, EJS and CSS).
      - Discover the implementation of CRUD operations.


## Introduction
The application will feature an inviting landing page that serves as the gateway into the user experience. A single call-to-action button will guide users to an overview of the vaporwave genre before granting access to the main index, which showcases the curated album collection. The design will adhere to the vaporwave aesthetic, evoking the same emotional resonance that listeners experience when engaging with this genre of music.


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 
The core objective is to deliver a fully functional MEN stack application. The technology will consist of Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, EJS, and CSS. The application will conform to the MVC file structure and will support seven RESTful routes with complete CRUD capabilities.


## Stretch Goals
## Aesthetic Enhancements:
- Leverage advanced CSS methods to enrich the user interface, incorporating transitions and animations for a more dynamic visual experience.

## API Integration:
- Utilize AJAX to fetch data from external sources and enrich the application's content. Additionally, enable a feature allowing users to listen to albums directly within the application's interface.
  
## Secure Route for Personal Note:
- Implement an encrypted, password-protected route accessible only to specific users, such as my boyfriend (this is his collection), to view a personalized note from me.
