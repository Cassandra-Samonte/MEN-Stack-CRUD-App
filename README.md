# MEN Stack - CRUD App
Technologies Used:

MEN Stack - CRUD App: A comprehensive application utilizing the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) paired with EJS for templating and CSS for styling.

MongoDB: A widely-adopted NoSQL database, MongoDB stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, making it versatile for a variety of applications.

Express.js: Serving as a minimalistic and adaptable web application framework within the Node.js environment, Express facilitates the creation of feature-rich web and mobile applications.

Node.js: Operating as a server-side platform, Node.js is constructed on Google Chrome's JavaScript runtime. This design promotes the development of scalable network-centric applications.

Bootstrap: This free and open-source CSS framework emphasizes responsive and mobile-first front-end web development, ensuring applications are accessible across devices of varying sizes.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates): EJS provides a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It's a key tool for rendering views in this MEN stack application.

CSS: The cornerstone of web aesthetics, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) provides the style definitions for how web content appears, allowing developers to craft visually appealing user interfaces.

## User Stories
## User Story 1: Collector and Community Contributor
- As a passionate album collector and member of the vaporwave community, I want a dedicated application to archive and showcase my growing album collection. With this app, I will be able to contribute to the vibrancy of the vaporwave genre by creating a centralized hub to share my collection. This will allow others to listen, share feedback, and engage with the content.
   - With this app I will be able to:
      - Add new albums to the collection.
      - Update album details.
      - Remove albums that are no longer relevant to my collection.
  
## User Story 2: Casual Web Visitor
- As a casual internet user interested in music, I want to discover this album collection and learn about the vaporwave genre, explore the albums, discover artists, and understand where to purchase or listen to the albums.
   - With this app I will be able to:
      - Browse albums.
      - Gain access to detailed information about each album and artist.
      - Have the ability to read reviews by other users of the application.
      - Have the option to contribute my own reviews or thoughts on albums.

## User Story 3: Prospective Employer
- As a prospective employer evaluating tech talent, I want to assess the developerâ€™s capabilities through this application so that I can determine whether their skill set aligns with the needs of my organization.
   - With this app I will be able to:
      - Evaluate a fully functioning application built using MEN-Stack (MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, Node.js, EJS and CSS).
      - Discover the implementation of CRUD operations.


## Introduction
The application will feature an inviting landing page that serves as the gateway into the user experience. A single call-to-action button will guide users to an overview of the vaporwave genre before granting access to the main index, which showcases the curated album collection. The design will adhere to the vaporwave aesthetic, evoking the same emotional resonance that listeners experience when engaging with this genre of music.


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 
The core objective is to deliver a fully functional MEN stack application. The technology will consist of Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, EJS, and CSS. The application will conform to the MVC file structure and will support seven RESTful routes with complete CRUD capabilities.


## Stretch Goals
## Aesthetic Enhancements:
- Leverage advanced CSS methods to enrich the user interface, incorporating transitions and animations for a more dynamic visual experience.

## API Integration:
- Utilize AJAX to fetch data from external sources and enrich the application's content. Additionally, enable a feature allowing users to listen to albums directly within the application's interface.
  
## Secure Route for Personal Note:
- Implement an encrypted, password-protected route accessible only to specific users, such as my boyfriend (this is his collection), to view a personalized note from me.

## Unsolved Problems & Major Hurdles
## Database Connections:
Initially, integrating MongoDB with Express was challenging. The addition of more schemas further compounded this complexity. To address this, I chose to reference the schemas rather than embed them, which facilitated the seamless integration of all seed data into the application.

## Responsive Design:
Implementing a mobile-optimized design with Bootstrap presented hurdles, especially in ensuring a uniform user interface (UI) across different devices. Through iterative testing on multiple screen dimensions, I tailored three unique backgrounds for mobile, tablet, and desktop interfaces to achieve design consistency. An outstanding issue remains with Bootstrap's navigation toggle button, which is non-responsive upon clicking. This is an area I am actively addressing.
